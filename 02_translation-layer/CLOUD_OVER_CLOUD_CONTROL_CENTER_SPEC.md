# Cloud-over-Cloud Control Center Spec

> Purpose: Coordinate the translation bridge between Gemini (Scout), Jules
> (Semantic Bridge), and Codex (Repo Bridge) to ensure seamless and governed
> relay of external signals into the repository corpus.

---

## 1. Core Definition

The Cloud-over-Cloud Control Center serves as the translation and coordination
bridge for the Legion dispatch system. It ensures that scouting data from
external environments is correctly translated into repository artifacts through
a governed relay flow.

---

## 2. Coordination Roles

- **Gemini (Scout Node):** Identifies and captures external signals, evidence,
  and raw data from cloud ecosystems (e.g., Google, Slack).
- **Jules (Semantic Bridge Node):** Translates raw scout data into structured
  XuanLing semantics, applying hardening rules and ensuring alignment.
- **Codex (Repo Bridge Node):** Performs repository hygiene, final structural
  verification, and registration of translated artifacts into the corpus.

---

## 3. Packet Contracts

All inter-node communication must use standard Packet Contracts:

### Scout Packet
- `Scout_ID`
- `Signal_Format`
- `Raw_Payload`
- `Discovery_Timestamp`

### Jules Packet
- `Asset_ID`
- `Semantic_Mapping`
- `Hardening_Flags`
- `Return_Path`

### Repo Packet
- `Commit_Hash`
- `File_Path`
- `Registry_Status`
- `Legion_Log`

---

## 4. Relay Flow

The relay flow follows a strict 4-stage sequence:

1. **Capture (Scout):** Raw signal identified and captured by Gemini.
2. **Evidence Classification (Scout):** Initial classification into `Radar`,
   `Signal`, or `Pending`.
3. **Semantic Translation (Jules):** Conversion of classified data into
   durable markdown artifacts, ensuring no forbidden semantic promotions.
4. **Registry Submission (Codex):** Final writeback to `main` and update of
   `REPOSITORY_CORPUS_INDEX.md` and `UNIFIED_ARTIFACT_REGISTER.md`.

---

## 5. Failure Handling

If any node fails to process its packet or violates a hardening rule:
- **Halt sequence.**
- **Route failure to AXIS-05.**
- **Log error** with `Return_Path` and `Risk_or_Blocker` fields.

---

## 6. Registration

- **ID:** SUBSYS-02-001
- **Primary Axis:** AXIS-01 (World Chain)
- **Secondary Axis:** AXIS-05 (Review Chain)
- **Status:** STRUCTURE_ESTABLISHED
