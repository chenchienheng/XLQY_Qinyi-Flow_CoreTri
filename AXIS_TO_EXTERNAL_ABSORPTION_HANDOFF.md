## 1. Current 5 Master Axes Summary

The master-chain view is established through the following 5 Master Axes:

1. **AXIS-01 World Chain (`WORLD_CHAIN_MASTER_AXIS.md`)**: The primary Coretri axis layer governing the external environment, ecosystem families, platform conditions, public surfaces, replacement logic, and anti-capture continuity. All future ecosystem and tool expansions map here before execution.
2. **AXIS-02 Existence Chain (`00_mother-law/existence-chain-master-layer.md`)**: Enforces the fundamental architectural rule that no execution task can proceed without clear existence anchoring (identity, ownership, and authority boundaries).
3. **AXIS-03 Time Chain (`TIME_CHAIN_MASTER_LAYER.md`)**: Governs scheduling topology, the 02_CVG_3D pulse, snapshot mechanism, and replay readiness. All runtime activation must bind to the time chain.
4. **AXIS-04 Space Chain (`SPACE_CHAIN_MASTER_LAYER.md`)**: The spatial positioning layer. Enforces the rule that all artifacts must have a spatial position within the topology.
5. **AXIS-05 Review Chain (`REVIEW_CHAIN_MASTER_LAYER.md`)**: Enforces that all important states must pass review before proceeding, ensuring structural stability and verifiable transitions.

## 2. Absorption of Execution Issues

Execution issues have been mapped under the Master Axes as 'absorbed execution
traces' to preserve trace and replay continuity. They are managed through state
layering rather than being closed:

- **#1**: Absorbed execution trace for re-indexing the existing repository
  corpus into a durable chain map (superseded/resolved).
- **#2**: Absorbed execution trace for extracting legacy seed
  (`xuanling-seed-v0-1`) into a controlled corpus map (superseded/resolved).
- **#6**: Absorbed execution trace mapped to the appropriate Master Axis for
  scheduler topology reconciliation to platform map.
- **#9**: Absorbed execution trace for the first standardized task packet run
  (registry + snapshot readiness).
- **#15**: Absorbed execution trace mapped to the appropriate Master Axis for
  governance proposal consolidation (snapshot + merge law + replay readiness).

## 3. Bridge Rule: External Ecosystem Absorption

External ecosystem absorption **must** enter through the
**AXIS-01 World Chain**.

Every external node being absorbed into the ecosystem must declare the following
on-chain conditions:
- **Primary Axis**: Which Master Axis it primarily binds to (must map to World
  Chain first).
- **Secondary Axis**: Any secondary Master Axis involved (if applicable).
- **Input**: The bounded input it accepts.
- **Output**: The bounded output it produces.
- **Review Path**: The path for verification and review.
- **Return Path**: The writeback surface proving its effect.
- **Return_Failed Route**: The fallback route directing failures to
  **AXIS-05 Review Chain**.

## 4. Handoff Instruction for Issue #37

**Issue #37 MUST use this handoff document as the prerequisite foundation.**
Issue #37 may build the external ecosystem absorption framework **only after**
reading this bridge document.
The absorption framework created in #37 must adhere strictly to the Bridge
Rule defined in Section 3 and align with the existing 5 Master Axes.

## 5. End Sections

### mismatch_or_gap
- `WORLD_CHAIN_MASTER_AXIS.md` (AXIS-01) was previously reverted (PR #27) and
  is not currently present on `main`. However, it remains the required entry
  point for external ecosystem absorption. This structural mismatch is being
  addressed by restoring a minimal version of AXIS-01 in the current task
  packet.

### unresolved_risks
- External nodes failing to properly route errors to the
  `return_failed route to AXIS-05` may bypass the required Review Chain, leading
  to unverified states.

### next_single_recommended_action
- Issue #37 should proceed with defining the external ecosystem absorption
  framework, explicitly referencing this handoff document and complying with
  the defined Bridge Rule.
