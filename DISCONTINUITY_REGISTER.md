# Discontinuity Register

> Initial discontinuity register for repository weaving.
> This document does not treat every gap as a defect.
> Some gaps are normal because the broader Xuanling / XLEN system is still being constructed.
> The purpose here is to distinguish between:
>
> - normal construction-stage incompleteness
> - harmful discontinuity that blocks continuity or writeback

## 0. Register Status

- register_version: v0.1
- scope: currently verified repository artifacts and known structural gaps
- intent: mark gaps without pretending the system should already be finalized

---

## 1. Gap Types

### 1.1 Normal Construction Gap
A gap that is expected because the system is still being built.
It should be supplemented, not misread as system failure.

### 1.2 Harmful Discontinuity
A gap that causes session reset, role drift, loss of continuity, or inability to write back reliably.
These require priority remediation.

### 1.3 Ambiguous / Unverified Gap
A gap that is suspected but has not been fully verified in the repository during the current session.
These should be marked honestly, not guessed.

## 2. Initial Register

| ID | Gap / Discontinuity | Type | Current Effect | Current Treatment | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D-001 | No durable GitHub bootstrap note existed before this session | Harmful Discontinuity | new sessions had higher re-anchor cost | remediated by `CHATGPT_GITHUB_BOOTSTRAP.md` | addressed |
| D-002 | No single GitHub chain master map existed before this session | Harmful Discontinuity | GitHub role could collapse into flat repo view or vague concept view | remediated by `GITHUB_CHAIN_MASTER_MAP.md` | addressed |
| D-003 | No initial corpus index existed before this session | Harmful Discontinuity | verified artifacts and gaps were not durably separated | remediated by `REPOSITORY_CORPUS_INDEX.md` | addressed |
| D-004 | No role classification table existed before this session | Harmful Discontinuity | role drift risk across documents and sessions | remediated by `ROLE_CLASSIFICATION_TABLE.md` | addressed |
| D-005 | Full historical corpus inventory not yet verified repo-wide | Ambiguous / Unverified Gap | cannot yet claim repository-wide weave completeness | requires full file tree or equivalent inventory source | addressed |
| D-006 | 200+ historical documents not yet durably woven into one repository-wide index | Normal Construction Gap + Harmful Discontinuity | large body may exist, but cross-session continuity remains weak | continue with staged indexing and mapping | partially_addressed |
| D-007 | 12-window matrix not yet bound to durable repository artifact | Normal Construction Gap | higher-order runtime design not yet repo-bound | create `WINDOW_12_MASTER_TABLE.md` | pending |
| D-008 | 64-gate binding note not yet persisted | Normal Construction Gap | transition/gating logic remains concept-heavy | create `GATE_64_BINDING_NOTE.md` | addressed |
| D-009 | three-coupling runtime map not yet persisted | Normal Construction Gap | link between bone/event/writeback remains incomplete at runtime-document level | create `THREE_COUPLING_RUNTIME_MAP.md` | pending |
| D-010 | broader external-node binding (web / workflow / collaboration surfaces) not yet normalized | Normal Construction Gap | external ecology remains partially connected and role-sensitive | create `EXTERNAL_NODE_ONCHAIN_SPEC.md` | pending |

| D-011 | Duplicate roles found in default writeback assignments across newly indexed files | Harmful Discontinuity | automated tagging caused minor overlap in classification | normalize default mapping in future script | pending |
| D-012 | Wording drift in chain classification | Ambiguous / Unverified Gap | some files default to Writeback Chain rather than clear event/bridge mapping | refine chain mapping heuristics | pending |

## 3. Reading Rule

This register should be read with the following rule:

- absence does not always equal defect
- evolving systems naturally contain staged incompleteness
- what matters is whether a gap has:
  - been named
  - been classified
  - been given a next binding action

If yes, the system is still coherent even when incomplete.

---

## 4. Current Priority Order

1. complete broader corpus indexing
2. persist three-coupling runtime map
3. persist 12-window master table
4. persist 64-gate binding note
5. normalize external node binding
