# [CoreTri] Minimal Execution Chain Run 01

> Execution Note: This document serves as the deliverable for running one
> complete chain using existing specifications without creating new specs,
> as per the minimal execution chain run request.

---

## 1. Scope

**Task:** Create a self-contained execution note
(`MINIMAL_EXECUTION_CHAIN_RUN_01.md`) to validate the minimal execution chain
routing without modifying any other files.

---

## 2. Chain Mapping

- **entry_condition:** The issue is mapped to AXIS-01 (world chain), as an
  absorption of an external task request into the core framework.
- **dispatch:** Priority 1 (Core framework structural integrity). Dispatched
  via Jules execution node.
- **review_hook:** Structural output review verified against 80-character
  limit and formatting rules.
- **tri_coupling_state_check:** Passed. No semantic drift; the return path
  is consistent, and no new axes are introduced.
- **return_path:** Writeback packet as `MINIMAL_EXECUTION_CHAIN_RUN_01.md`
  added to the repository structure.

---

## 3. Lifecycle Execution

- **propose:** Task defined as a minimal execution chain validation.
- **issue_created:** Logged as issue/PR into GitHub for tracking.
- **jules_started:** Execution node initiated context gathering.
- **pr_opened:** Proposed markdown deliverable pushed to traceable branch.
- **review_ready:** Structural alignment evaluated.
- **human_approved:** (Pending user review of the PR)
- **merged:** (Pending final merge to main branch)
- **return_to_00:** Return path trace to be closed upon merge.

---

## 4. Delta-only Check

- **Confirmed:** No full context reload was required. Only existing rules
  (`MULTI_CHAIN_DISPATCH_GOVERNANCE.md`, `TRI_COUPLING_STATE_SPEC.md`,
  `TASK_ORCHESTRATION_BRIDGE_SPEC.md`, `REDUNDANT_LOAD_REDUCTION_SPEC.md`)
  were read.
- **Confirmed:** Only the specific delta (this new file) is applied.

---

## 5. Review Surface Check

- **Confirmed:** Single review surface exists on the generated PR.
- **Confirmed:** No duplicated review across external AI memory nodes.

---

## 6. Return-to-Register Check

- **Pending:** Upon merge, this file should be mapped to the tracking
  registers (`REPOSITORY_CORPUS_INDEX.md`).

---

## 7. Failure Route Check

- **Confirmed:** If any step fails during verification (e.g., formatting
  violation), failure routes to AXIS-05 for manual oversight.

---

## 8. mismatch_or_gap

None currently identified. The task was executed strictly within existing
boundaries without expanding runtime or creating new axes.

---

## 9. unresolved_risks

- Temporary execution state is held in the Jules node until human approval;
  if the PR process halts, it could lead to an abandoned branch.

---

## 10. next_single_recommended_action

Review and merge this minimal execution chain report, then append it to
`REPOSITORY_CORPUS_INDEX.md` and `UNIFIED_ARTIFACT_REGISTER.md`.
