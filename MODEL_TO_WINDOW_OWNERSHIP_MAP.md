# Model to Window Ownership Map

> Durable mapping between model families and runtime windows.
> Purpose: prevent model usage from floating outside the 12-window runtime frame.

## 0. Core Reading

Model families must not operate without window ownership.
This map defines preferred bindings so:
- roles are stabilized
- drift is reduced
- scheduling can attach correctly
- writeback becomes consistent

## 1. Mapping Table

| Model Family | Primary Windows | Secondary Windows | Role Bias |
|---|---|---|---|
| reasoning | `05`, `11`, `00` | `03` | analysis / comparison / chain reading |
| drafting | `01`, `07`, `12` | `02` | articulation / external expression |
| audit | `00`, `08`, `11` | `05` | contradiction / verification |
| extraction | `02`, `03`, `08` | `01` | field extraction / grouping |
| synthesis | `11`, `05`, `00` | `07` | integration / folding |
| interface_dialogue | `02`, `07` | `03` | intake / clarification |
| vision_multimodal | `02`, `07`, `12` | `11` | visual interpretation |
| domain_specialized | varies | varies | domain-bound operations |

## 2. Binding Rule

Each invocation must:
- declare its owner_window
- match the family-window compatibility
- escalate if mismatch occurs

---

## 3. Mismatch Rule

If model family and window are misaligned:
- mark mismatch_or_gap
- reassign window OR change role
- do not silently proceed

---

## 4. Scheduling Implication

This mapping directly supports:
- `SCHEDULING_EFFECT_REGISTER.md`
- window-based cadence activation

---

## 5. Status

- model_window_map_created: true
- drift_reduction_binding_started: true
- scheduling_alignment_enabled: true
- return_to_00: true
