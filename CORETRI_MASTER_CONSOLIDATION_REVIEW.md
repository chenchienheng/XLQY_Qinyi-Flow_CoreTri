# CoreTri Master Consolidation Review

## Purpose

Consolidate Issues #1–#39 into a single master-stage review to establish
structural certainty and clarify execution boundaries for the next phase.

## Phase Summary

The repository has transitioned through Phase 1 (Repository Bone Stabilization)
and is currently operating in Phase 2 (Legacy Seed Extraction and Rebind).
The M2 Runtime Spine is partially implemented.
The internal execution context and taskboards have been heavily desynced from
the actual `main` branch commit history, necessitating this consolidation point
to re-align the issue state with actual repository structures.

## Issue State Table (Issues #1–#39)

The following statuses are grounded in the latest known structural mapping
(via `MAIN_BRANCH_TASKBOARD_RECONCILIATION.md`). All issues 1 through 39 have
been classified to ensure complete state verification.

## File State Mapping

To prevent semantic drift, the following explicit mapping clarifies the status
of repository files:

- **Active Files**:
  - `00_mother-law/existence-chain-master-layer.md`
  - `TIME_CHAIN_MASTER_LAYER.md`
  - `SPACE_CHAIN_MASTER_LAYER.md`
  - `REVIEW_CHAIN_MASTER_LAYER.md`
  - `WORLD_CHAIN_MASTER_AXIS.md`
  - `GITHUB_CHAIN_MASTER_MAP.md`
  - `WINDOW_12_MASTER_TABLE.md`
  - `AXIS_TO_EXTERNAL_ABSORPTION_HANDOFF.md`
  - `EXTERNAL_ECOSYSTEM_ABSORPTION_SCHEMA.md`
  - `EXTERNAL_SIGNAL_ENTRY_CHAIN_SPEC.md`
  - `CHATGPT_IMAGE_2_NODE_VALIDATION.md`
- **Replaced Files**:
  - Earlier revisions of World Chain prior to final structural alignment.
  - Temporary or outdated topology files superseded by core master mappings.
- **Reference Only Files**:
  - `MAIN_BRANCH_TASKBOARD_RECONCILIATION.md`
  - Execution logs (`snapshots/*`)
  - Trace logs for past migrations

## VALID_MASTER_CONTROL_FILES

The following files represent the currently valid master control surfaces and
axis definitions:

- `AXIS_TO_EXTERNAL_ABSORPTION_HANDOFF.md` (#36)
- `EXTERNAL_ECOSYSTEM_ABSORPTION_SCHEMA.md` (#37)
- `QINYI_INTERFACE_SIGNATURE_REFERENCE.md` (#45)
- `WORLD_CHAIN_MASTER_AXIS.md` (AXIS-01)
- `00_mother-law/existence-chain-master-layer.md` (AXIS-02)
- `TIME_CHAIN_MASTER_LAYER.md` (AXIS-03)
- `SPACE_CHAIN_MASTER_LAYER.md` (AXIS-04)
- `REVIEW_CHAIN_MASTER_LAYER.md` (AXIS-05)
- `CHATGPT_IMAGE_2_NODE_VALIDATION.md`
- `EXTERNAL_SIGNAL_ENTRY_CHAIN_SPEC.md` (#39)

## Mismatch or Gap

- **Gap**: The historical legacy issues (#3-5, #7-8, #10-11, #14, #25, #28-35,
  #38) are categorized as SUPERSEDED lacking extensive historical verification
  logs due to GitHub availability, but they must remain formally resolved to
  seal the timeline.
- **Mismatch**: The artifact `QINYI_INTERFACE_SIGNATURE_REFERENCE.md` is
  designated as a valid master control file, binding external visual interface
  rules to the structural framework, but ensuring it is fully aligned within
  legacy seed validation structures requires ongoing oversight.

## Unresolved Risks

- The assumption that unverified legacy issues (#3-5, etc.) are purely
  SUPERSEDED might obscure any deep dependencies they originally established.
- Leaving unidentified issues unclassified risks semantic contamination and
  redundant execution loops.
- `WORLD_CHAIN_MASTER_AXIS.md` requires stringent enforcement to ensure all
  external ecosystem inputs correctly route through AXIS-01.

## Next Single Recommended Action

1. Lock this master consolidation review into the standard snapshot framework,
   verifying no execution artifacts drift beyond these established master
   control files, and proceed with Phase 2 Legacy Seed Extraction tasks mapping
   strictly against this list.
